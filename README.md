In this project I modified the current working page to display a random generated password.
I started off by usinf javascript to store my varibles and created if else statments to prompt the user
to choose the number of charters that they world like the password to be. i then created a function that uses a for loop
to pass that throught a number of random letters and charters to return to the user after the generate password button is clicked.
